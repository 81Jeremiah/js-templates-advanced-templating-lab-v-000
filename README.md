## Objectives

1. Practice using Handlebars templates
2. Practice defining Handlebars helpers
3. Practice using Handlebars partials

## Introduction

- Briefly review Handlebars templates and helpers
- Introduce the concept of a partial (a brief code-along should get students going)
- Students will build a basic recipe application, so frame the narrative around that

## Implementation

- Students should define a helper for formatting ingredients (?)
- Students should define partials for ingredients lists and recipe bodies
- A partial can be reused for the create/edit form
